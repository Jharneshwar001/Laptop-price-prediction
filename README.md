This project builds a Laptop Price Prediction system using Random Forest with an accuracy of 89% and Streamlit for interactive deployment. Developed with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Pickle, it processes laptop specifications (brand, RAM, CPU, GPU, screen size, resolution) to estimate prices. The model is integrated into a Streamlit web app, providing instant predictions. This tool aids consumers and retailers in understanding price trends, making it a strong addition to GitHub and professional resumes.
